# advent-of-code

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

Written in several different languages, based (mostly) on what I felt like using that day
and (partly) on what I thought was the best tool for solving a particular puzzle.

**NOTE:** Some of the solutions are of rather poor quality. Basically, as soon as I get the right answer,
I drop the code and don't spend any more time on it. As such, some of the stuff you see might be borderline brilliant,
and some of it would get me kicked out of a job interview on the grounds of being an idiot.
