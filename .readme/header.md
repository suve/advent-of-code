Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

Written in several different languages, based (mostly) on what I felt like using that day
and (partly) on what I thought was the best tool for solving a particular puzzle.

**NOTE:** Some of the solutions are of rather poor quality. Basically, as soon as I get the right answer,
I drop the code and don't spend any more time on it. As such, some of the stuff you see here might quite literally
be broken, as in "it worked with my input" â€“ but might fail with yours.
